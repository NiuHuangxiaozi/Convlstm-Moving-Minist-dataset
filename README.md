# Convlstm(Moving-Minist-dataset)

Abstract:
This repository is my little  outcome after reading the paper.The paper's url is:https://paperswithcode.com/paper/convolutional-lstm-network-a-machine-learning. To test my understanding of the model,I try to write the code using Moving Minist dataset.
The dataset can be download from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/
The relevant official model I learned can be found from two urlsï¼š
